# CryptoAddressCopier

Installing CryptoAddressCopier
This README file provides instructions on how to install CryptoAddressCopier as a Chrome extension. The process is relatively simple and is intended for developers who want to test or use their own extensions before submitting them to the Chrome Web Store.

Prerequisites
Google Chrome browser installed on your computer.
A locally developed Chrome extension with a valid manifest.json file.
Steps to Install the Locally Developed Chrome Extension
Enable Developer Mode in Google Chrome:

Open Google Chrome.
Click on the three-dot menu icon in the top-right corner of the browser window, and then navigate to "More tools" > "Extensions."
On the "Extensions" page, you'll find a toggle switch in the top-right corner labeled "Developer mode." Enable it.
Load the Unpacked Extension:

Click on the "Load unpacked" button that appears after enabling Developer Mode.
A file explorer window will open. Navigate to the directory containing your locally developed Chrome extension.
Select the folder containing the extension's manifest.json file, and then click "Open."
Verify the Installation:

Your locally developed Chrome extension should now be visible in the "Extensions" page, along with its icon and details.
The extension will also appear in the browser's toolbar if it has a user interface component.
Using the Extension:

You can now use your locally developed Chrome extension as you normally would with an extension downloaded from the Chrome Web Store.
Updating the Locally Developed Chrome Extension
If you make changes to the extension's source code, you'll need to reload the extension to see the changes take effect. To do this:

Go to the "Extensions" page in Chrome (Menu > More tools > Extensions).
Find your locally developed extension in the list and click the "Reload" button (circular arrow) next to it.
Uninstalling the Locally Developed Chrome Extension
To uninstall your locally developed Chrome extension:

Go to the "Extensions" page in Chrome (Menu > More tools > Extensions).
Find your extension in the list and click the "Remove" button.
Confirm the removal by clicking "Remove" in the prompt that appears.
Please note that these instructions are for locally developed Chrome extensions and may not apply to extensions obtained from the Chrome Web Store. If you wish to submit your extension to the Chrome Web Store, follow the official documentation for further instructions.
